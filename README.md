This project is in response to Live Session Assignment 5 and was compiled by Bama Parthasarathy, Hassan Azhar, Laura Jarzombek and Oral Fredric. It is a representation of a working, reproducible project and is structured such that anyone interested could easily replicate the same results.

The original assignment guidelines provided as follows:
•	Goal: Create an RStudio project for the analysis of this data set. Your file structure within the project should include the following:
–	A README file in the project root directory that includes an explanation of the purpose of the project and the other files
–	A data directory containing files to load in and clean up the data. The clean up should include finding out where there are outliers or missing values, deciding how you will treat them, making sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such (correct R class), etc.
–	An Analysis directory containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis on the clean data to visualize compare the square footage and sales price for your neighborhood.
–	A Paper directory containing a file (plain text or Markdown) that explains any meaningful patterns in this dataset.

•	Note: I am indifferent to the names of the directories as long as they a generally descriptive of the contents and follow naming conventions discussed in Gandrud.
•	Deliverable: A link to a repository on GitHub containing the above. I need only one link per group. Since this is a group project, I expect you to divide the labor.


Key project files are as follows:
•/Analysis/Data/rollingsales_bronx.csv - This is the raw NYC-Queens home sale price data analyzed during this project and was obtained from http://www1.nyc.gov/home/search/index.page?search-terms=Rolling+sales+update
•/Analysis/RollingSales_Analysis.R - This R module plots the data of interest, sale price with respect to square footage, and further assess the effects of outliers.
•/Paper/TheQueensHousingCosts_Paper.md - This is the central writeup for the project and sources all project code modules to display code outputs and to provide project flow summary and analysis discussion.
